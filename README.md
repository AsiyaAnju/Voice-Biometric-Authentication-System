Voice Biometric Authentication System focuses on verifying user identity through unique vocal characteristics instead of traditional passwords or PINs. It leverages Deep learning algorithms, and anti-spoofing mechanisms to provide a secure, seamless, and efficient authentication method. The system analyzes distinct vocal features such as tone, pitch, frequency, and speech patterns to create a voiceprint for each user. This approach enhances security, convenience, and accessibility, making it ideal for applications in banking, IoT devices, smart home systems, enterprise security, and hands-free authentication scenarios.

## Overview 

* The Voice Biometric Authentication System is a real-time speaker verification framework that enhances security using machine learning-based voice recognition. 
* It extracts unique voice features using MFCCs and applies preprocessing techniques like noise suppression and pre-emphasis filtering for improved clarity. 
* The system employs Euclidean distance-based matching with a dynamic threshold to minimize false acceptances and rejections, and uses CNN-based speaker recognition for accurate spectrogram-based classification. 
* The backend is Python-based, enabling secure and efficient voice authentication. 
* Extensive testing under various conditions confirms high accuracy and robustness, making the system suitable for applications like banking, IoT, and access control.

# Installation and Set-up
1. Clone the Repository
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/AsiyaAnju/Voice-Biometric-Authentication-System.git
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;cd Voice-Biometric-Authentication-System

2. Install Dependencies
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Script
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;python main.py

4. Setup Authentication (First Time)
* Enter a username
* Speak 3 times to register your voice
* Your averaged voiceprint will be saved

5. Verify Authentication
* Enter your username again
* Speak once
* System checks similarity with stored voiceprint

<br>‚û°Ô∏è Important:
<br>Works best in a quiet environment
<br>Accuracy may drop with background noise
<br>Threshold can be adjusted in code (similarity < 25)
<br>Currently stores data locally only (no server/database)
